# ArobicOS


## Intro
ArobicOS is a Lightweight, Linux-based OS in HTML/CSS/JS.

This OS is in ALPHA, so expect bugs.

Arobic is primarily tested as a vm, but you can use this as a primary OS(Just not reccomended)

The frontend is all coded in HTML/CSS/JS, but under the hood it uses https://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/ and a custom script(https://github.com/MagnusStrom/arobicos-to-iso/) to provide a simple file system and terminal. Everything else is ran by Arobic.


## Screenshots

## Building
ArobicOS is built using electron, so install electron using the tutorial at https://www.electronjs.org/ and run npm start in the folder. This will create a debug build.

## FAQ
**Why?**: I was really into HTML at the time of starting this and wanted to show off my skill, so I made this. Now I get random bursts of motivation to continue it.

**No, why would I use it?**: It's a good simple os for VM testing, or just to mess around.
